  <h1>“Nature is pleased with simplicity.” Isaac Newton</h1>
  <p>Look at the trees, look at the birds, look at the clouds, look at the stars and if you have eyes you will be able to see that the whole existence is joyful. Everything is simply happy. Trees are happy for no reason; they are not going to become prime ministers or presidents and they are not going to become rich and they will never have any bank balance. Look at the flowers — for no reason. It is simply unbelievable how happy flowers are.</p>

          <p> I arise today
            Through the strength of heaven:
            Light of sun,
            Radiance of moon,
            Splendour of fire.
            Speed of lightning,
            Swiftness of wind,
            Depth of sea,
            Stability of earth,
            Firmness of rock.  Saint Patrick

            These are brand-new birds of   
            twelve-months' growing,  
            Which a year ago, or less than twain,   
            No finches were, nor nightingales,  
            Nor thrushes,     
            But only particles of grain,   
            And earth and air, and rain.  Thomas Hardy

            What a joy it is to feel the soft, springy earth under my feet once more,    
            to follow grassy roads that lead to ferny brooks    
            where I can bathe my fingers in a cataract of rippling notes,    
            or to clamber over a stone wall into green fields that    
            tumble and roll and climb in riotous gladness!  Helen Keller

        <p>Between our phones, tablets, laptops, and televisions, some form of screen time is happening almost 24/7. That's why it's become more imperative than ever for us to unplug and head out into the great outdoors. Getting out into nature doesn't have to be a big event. Go out for a jog or a brisk walk—without your phone!—and take in the sights and sounds of your surroundings. You might be surprised by how much you're missing—early spring flowers, pretty ground cover plants—right in your very neighborhood. But if you're feeling a little more ambitious, you can recite a few hiking quotes or camping quotes, and then plan a family vacation in some of the best camping spots in national parks. Need further inspiration? We got it covered with these 45 quotes all about the awesomeness of nature.</p>
